
**Rust-AB** is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. 

Rust-AB is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.

:zap:  The actual community effort on Rust-AB is mainly devoted to supporting **Parallel** execution and model **Visualization** using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).
