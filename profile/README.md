
*krABMaga** is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. 

krABMaga is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.
