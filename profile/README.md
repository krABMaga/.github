  <h2> <i>A modern novel developing art for reliable and efficient ABM simulation with the Rust language</i></h2>
</div>

KrABMaga is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. krABMaga is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.
