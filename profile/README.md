  <h3> <i>A modern developing art for reliable and efficient ABM simulation with the Rust language</i></h3>
</div>

KrABMaga is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. krABMaga is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.

***Fun fact about the name of our project***

> When we were looking for a name for our library, we named it as typical as possible by combining the Rust language name with Agent-based (Rust-AB). Our project started to get better and better, and we moved from a prototype of an ABM simulation framework to an accurate tool. As good computer scientists, we started looking again for a name that would give a more significant entity to our project. We have finally found it in the martial art of Krav Maga; this art, as our tool, is based on two principal goals: reliability and efficiency. Therefore, we combined Crab (Krab) ðŸ¦€ with Maga and obtained **krABMaga**.
